# Abstract

Most recent applications and developments in geophysics applied to modern viticulture are unravelling new management strategies for grape and wine production. Geophysical technologies have been employed by Sogrape to optimize the creation and foster resilient management of our vineyards. Geophysical methods such as electrical resistivity and hyperspectral imaging, as well as the use of geomatics for advanced vineyard monitoring are allowing to move from low to high-resolution sampling and from deterministic to probabilistic farm management. These technologies have contributed to a more sustainable and efficient viticulture, allowing for high-quality innovative wines while adding value to other vineyard and winery byproducts. The integration of these innovative techniques has allowed Sogrape to advance the understanding of the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum and successfully respond to environmental, production and market challenges.
