  title: Investigating soil-plant-atmosphere interactions by combining spectral electrical impedance tomography with environmental and physiological timeseries
  description: The soil-plant-atmosphere continuum plays a critical role in the distribution of water and nutrients in terrestrial ecosystems. In this study, we monitored water and nutrient transport processes in a maize field over several months with spectral electrical impedance tomography, sapflow sensors, a fluorescence sensor, and a weather station.
